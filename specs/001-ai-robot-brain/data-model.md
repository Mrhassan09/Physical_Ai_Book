# Data Model: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This project is focused on generating educational content rather than developing a software system with a traditional data model. Therefore, there are no specific entities, fields, relationships, or validation rules in the context of a database or API.

However, the conceptual "entities" within this module can be understood as:

-   **NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform**: Represents the overarching ecosystem, including software, hardware, and development tools.
-   **Isaac Sim Environment**: Consists of simulation assets, scene configurations, physics settings, and synthetic data generation pipelines.
-   **Isaac ROS Packages**: Comprises specific ROS 2 packages for hardware acceleration, VSLAM, and navigation.
-   **Nav2 Modules**: Represents components of the ROS 2 Navigation Stack tailored for humanoid movement.
-   **Code Examples**: Practical implementations of algorithms and configurations using Python or C++.
-   **Diagrams**: Visual representations of architecture, workflows, and data flows.
-   **Citations/References**: Metadata about external sources (APA style).
