# Data Model: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This project is focused on generating educational content rather than developing a software system with a traditional data model. Therefore, there are no specific entities, fields, relationships, or validation rules in the context of a database or API.

However, the conceptual "entities" within this module can be understood as:

-   **Digital Twin Concept**: Represented by definitions, principles, and architectural diagrams.
-   **Gazebo Simulation**: Consists of simulation environments, robot models (URDF/SDF), physics configurations, and simulation control scripts.
-   **Unity Environment**: Comprises 3D assets, scene configurations, rendering settings, and interaction scripts.
-   **Sensor Models**: Defined by their physical properties, simulation parameters, and data output formats (e.g., LiDAR point clouds, depth images, IMU data).
-   **Simulation Examples**: Practical step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and configuration files.
-   **Citations/References**: Metadata about external sources (APA style).
