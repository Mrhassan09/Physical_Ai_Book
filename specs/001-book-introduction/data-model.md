# Data Model: Introduction: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This project is focused on generating educational content rather than developing a software system with a traditional data model. Therefore, there are no specific entities, fields, relationships, or validation rules in the context of a database or API.

However, the conceptual "entities" within this module can be understood as:

-   **Physical AI Concept**: Represented by its definition, significance, and relationship to robotics.
-   **Embodied Intelligence**: Defined by its concept and relation to Physical AI.
-   **Humanoid Robot**: Characterized by its form, function, and importance in human-centered environments.
-   **Book Module**: Each module represents a section of the book, with its own topic and content.
-   **Real-world Applications**: Examples of Physical AI in practice.
-   **Future Trends**: Emerging directions in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
-   **Citations/References**: Metadata about external sources (APA style).
