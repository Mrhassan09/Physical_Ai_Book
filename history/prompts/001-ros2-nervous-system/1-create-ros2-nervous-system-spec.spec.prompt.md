## Response

Created a new feature specification for "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" under branch `001-ros2-nervous-system`.
The specification includes user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria.
A corresponding `requirements.md` checklist has been generated and validated, with all items marked as complete.
The spec file is located at `specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/spec.md`.
The checklist file is located at `specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/checklists/requirements.md`.
